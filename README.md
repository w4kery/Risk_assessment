# Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Project

## Task Overview

### What you'll learn
- How to identify, evaluate, and prioritize potential security threats and vulnerabilities.
- Developing plans to mitigate identified risks.

### What you'll do
- Complete a risk assessment for a client.
- Define context, assess risk matrix, and identify potential risk scenarios.

## Background Information

Congratulations on completing the initial task! Your research on the APT group laid the foundation for the current task - a comprehensive risk assessment for the client. As a cybersecurity consultant, you will identify, evaluate, and prioritize potential security threats and vulnerabilities. This involves defining the context, assessing the risk matrix, and identifying potential risk scenarios.

## Your Task

1. **Define the context:**
   - Identify assets to be protected (e.g., customer data, business information, financial data, intellectual property).

2. **Define the risk matrix:**
   - Likelihood, consequence, and risk rating for each potential risk scenario.

3. **Define three risk scenarios:**
   - Identify specific risks (e.g., cyberattack, natural disaster, employee negligence).

4. **Assess risk ratings:**
   - Calculate inherent, current, and target risk ratings for each scenario.

5. **Create a risk assessment report:**
   - Summarize findings, propose a risk mitigation strategy, and recommend measures.

## Example Risk Scenario

A cyberattack aimed at stealing sensitive information:
- Likelihood: High
- Consequence: Major
- Inherent Risk Rating: Very High
- Current Risk Rating: Possible Major (with existing measures)
- Target Risk Rating: Unlikely Moderate (with additional measures)

## Cybersecurity Definitions

- **Risk assessment:** A process of identifying, analyzing, and mitigating potential risks.
- **Risk position:** The level of risk an organization faces.
- **Risk matrix:** A tool to assess and evaluate risks based on likelihood and consequence.
- **Likelihood:** The probability of a risk event occurring.
- **Consequence:** The severity of the potential impact of a risk event.
- **Risk rating:** Overall risk posed by a scenario (likelihood * consequence).
- **Inherent risk rating:** Rating without measures in place.
- **Current risk rating:** Rating with existing measures.
- **Target risk rating:** Desired rating with additional measures.
- **Risk assessment report:** Summarizes findings, mitigation strategy, and recommendations.

## Context - Assets to Protect

- Confidential customer data
- Proprietary business information
- Financial information
- Intellectual property
- Physical infrastructure & equipment

## Summary

The goal is to help the client prioritize and implement security measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their information. Your work will aid compliance with regulatory requirements and provide peace of mind to the client.

Best of luck with your risk assessment!
