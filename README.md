# Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Project

## Task Overview

### What you'll learn
- How to identify, evaluate, and prioritize potential security threats and vulnerabilities.
- Developing plans to mitigate identified risks.

### What you'll do
- Complete a risk assessment for a client.
- Define context, assess risk matrix, and identify potential risk scenarios.

## Background Information

Congratulations on completing the initial task! Your research on the APT group laid the foundation for the current task - a comprehensive risk assessment for the client. As a cybersecurity consultant, you will identify, evaluate, and prioritize potential security threats and vulnerabilities. This involves defining the context, assessing the risk matrix, and identifying potential risk scenarios.

## Your Task

1. **Define the context:**
   - Identify assets to be protected (e.g., customer data, business information, financial data, intellectual property).

2. **Define the risk matrix:**
   - Likelihood, consequence, and risk rating for each potential risk scenario.

3. **Define three risk scenarios:**
   - Identify specific risks (e.g., cyberattack, natural disaster, employee negligence).

4. **Assess risk ratings:**
   - Calculate inherent, current, and target risk ratings for each scenario.

5. **Create a risk assessment report:**
   - Summarize findings, propose a risk mitigation strategy, and recommend measures.

## Example Risk Scenario

A cyberattack aimed at stealing sensitive information:
- Likelihood: High
- Consequence: Major
- Inherent Risk Rating: Very High
- Current Risk Rating: Possible Major (with existing measures)
- Target Risk Rating: Unlikely Moderate (with additional measures)

## Cybersecurity Definitions

- **Risk assessment:** A process of identifying, analyzing, and mitigating potential risks.
- **Risk position:** The level of risk an organization faces.
- **Risk matrix:** A tool to assess and evaluate risks based on likelihood and consequence.
- **Likelihood:** The probability of a risk event occurring.
- **Consequence:** The severity of the potential impact of a risk event.
- **Risk rating:** Overall risk posed by a scenario (likelihood * consequence).
- **Inherent risk rating:** Rating without measures in place.
- **Current risk rating:** Rating with existing measures.
- **Target risk rating:** Desired rating with additional measures.
- **Risk assessment report:** Summarizes findings, mitigation strategy, and recommendations.

## Context - Assets to Protect

- Confidential customer data
- Proprietary business information
- Financial information
- Intellectual property
- Physical infrastructure & equipment
