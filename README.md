# Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Project

## Task Overview

### What you'll learn
- How to identify, evaluate, and prioritize potential security threats and vulnerabilities.
- Developing plans to mitigate identified risks.

### What you'll do
- Complete a risk assessment for a client.
- Define context, assess risk matrix, and identify potential risk scenarios.

## Background Information

Congratulations on completing the initial task! Your research on the APT group laid the foundation for the current task - a comprehensive risk assessment for the client. As a cybersecurity consultant, you will identify, evaluate, and prioritize potential security threats and vulnerabilities. This involves defining the context, assessing the risk matrix, and identifying potential risk scenarios.

## Your Task

1. **Define the context:**
   - Identify assets to be protected (e.g., customer data, business information, financial data, intellectual property).

2. **Define the risk matrix:**
   - Likelihood, consequence, and risk rating for each potential risk scenario.

3. **Define three risk scenarios:**
   - Identify specific risks (e.g., cyberattack, natural disaster, employee negligence).

4. **Assess risk ratings:**
   - Calculate inherent, current, and target risk ratings for each scenario.

5. **Create a risk assessment report:**
   - Summarize findings, propose a risk mitigation strategy, and recommend measures.

## Example Risk Scenario

A cyberattack aimed at stealing sensitive information:
- Likelihood: High
- Consequence: Major
- Inherent Risk Rating: Very High
- Current Risk Rating: Possible Major (with existing measures)
- Target Risk Rating: Unlikely Moderate (with additional measures)

## Cybersecurity Definitions

- **Risk assessment:** A process of identifying, analyzing, and mitigating potential risks.
- **Risk position:** The level of risk an organization faces.
- **Risk matrix:** A tool to assess and evaluate risks based on likelihood and consequence.
- **Likelihood:** The probability of a risk event occurring.
- **Consequence:** The severity of the potential impact of a risk event.
- **Risk rating:** Overall risk posed by a scenario (likelihood * consequence).
- **Inherent risk rating:** Rating without measures in place.
- **Current risk rating:** Rating with existing measures.
- **Target risk rating:** Desired rating with additional measures.
- **Risk assessment report:** Summarizes findings, mitigation strategy, and recommendations.

## Context - Assets to Protect

- Confidential customer data
- Proprietary business information
- Financial information
- Intellectual property
- Physical infrastructure & equipment

# Summary

## Project Overview

Congratulations on successfully completing the first task! In this cybersecurity consultancy project, your initial research on the APT group has set the stage for a critical phase: conducting a comprehensive risk assessment for the client.

## Project Objectives

### Understanding the Client's Concerns

The client currently employs basic security measures, including a perimeter fence and entrance gate padlock. However, they express concern about potential risks and vulnerabilities that could compromise the security of their information and systems.

### The Role of a Cybersecurity Consultant

As a cybersecurity consultant, your role is to guide the client through a thorough risk assessment process. This involves identifying, evaluating, and prioritizing potential security threats and vulnerabilities. The ultimate goal is to determine the level of risk and develop a strategic plan to mitigate these risks effectively.

## Specific Tasks

### Defining the Context

- **Identifying Critical Assets:**
  Define the assets that require protection, encompassing confidential customer data, proprietary business information, financial records, intellectual property, and physical infrastructure.

### Assessing the Risk Matrix

- **Evaluating Likelihood and Consequence:**
  Utilize the risk matrix to assess the likelihood and consequence of potential risk scenarios, providing a comprehensive view of the overall risk landscape.

### Identifying Risk Scenarios

- **Defining Specific Risks:**
  Identify and define three specific risk scenarios, such as cyberattacks, natural disasters, and employee negligence, that the client aims to safeguard against.

### Calculating Risk Ratings

- **Assessing Inherent, Current, and Target Risk Ratings:**
  Calculate risk ratings for each scenario without existing measures, with existing measures, and with additional measures in place.

### Creating a Comprehensive Report

- **Summarizing Findings and Recommendations:**
  Prepare a detailed risk assessment report summarizing findings, proposing a risk mitigation strategy, and recommending specific measures for implementation.

## Project Impact

Your efforts in this project aim to empower the client to make informed decisions regarding their cybersecurity strategy. The outcomes will contribute not only to risk reduction but also to regulatory compliance, reputation protection, and the preservation of financial resources.
